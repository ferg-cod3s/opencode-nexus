## Ticket Synopsis

Research the authentication system in OpenCode Nexus to understand how it works, including security patterns, implementation details, and architectural decisions.

## Summary

The authentication system in OpenCode Nexus is a robust, security-focused implementation designed for desktop applications. It uses Argon2 password hashing with salt for secure storage, implements account lockout after 5 failed attempts, and supports session-based authentication with 24-hour expiration. The system is owner-only, meaning only the initial account created during onboarding can authenticate, providing a single-user model suitable for local AI development tools.

Key components include:
- **Backend**: Rust implementation in `src-tauri/src/auth.rs` with Argon2 hashing, lockout protection, and session management
- **Frontend**: Astro/Svelte UI in `frontend/src/pages/login.astro` with form validation and error handling
- **Security**: Multi-layer protection including input validation, audit logging, and secure error messages
- **Testing**: Comprehensive TDD approach with unit and E2E tests covering authentication flows

The system follows enterprise security best practices while maintaining usability for desktop applications.

## Detailed Findings

### Core Authentication Logic

**Primary Implementation**: `src-tauri/src/auth.rs`
- **Password Hashing**: Uses Argon2 with cryptographically secure random salts
- **Account Lockout**: Locks account after 5 failed attempts for 30 minutes
- **Session Management**: Creates 24-hour sessions on successful authentication
- **Input Validation**: Enforces password complexity (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers)

**Key Functions**:
- `create_user()`: Creates new user with password validation and hashing
- `authenticate()`: Verifies credentials, handles lockout, creates sessions
- `validate_password()`: Enforces security requirements
- `log_login_attempt()`: Maintains audit trail

### Security Patterns

**Argon2 Password Hashing**:
```rust
let salt = SaltString::generate(&mut OsRng);
let argon2 = Argon2::default();
let password_hash = argon2.hash_password(password.as_bytes(), &salt)?;
```

**Account Lockout Protection**:
```rust
if auth_config.failed_login_attempts >= 5 {
    auth_config.locked_until = Some(Utc::now() + chrono::Duration::minutes(30));
}
```

**Password Verification**:
```rust
let parsed_hash = PasswordHash::new(&auth_config.password_hash)?;
argon2.verify_password(password.as_bytes(), &parsed_hash)?;
```

### Frontend Integration

**Login Interface**: `frontend/src/pages/login.astro`
- Form validation before API calls
- Loading states and user feedback
- Session storage for authentication state
- Automatic redirect on success

**Tauri Commands**: `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`
- `authenticate_user()`: Secure frontend-to-backend bridge
- Owner account validation
- Security logging to Sentry

### Testing and Quality Assurance

**Unit Tests**: `src-tauri/src/auth.rs` (comprehensive test suite)
- Password hashing verification
- Lockout mechanism testing
- Session creation validation

**E2E Tests**: `frontend/e2e/authentication.spec.ts`
- Full authentication flow testing
- Error handling validation

### Architectural Insights

**Single-Owner Model**: Only the account created during onboarding can authenticate, reflecting desktop application paradigm where one user owns the local OpenCode server.

**File-Based Storage**: Uses JSON configuration files for persistence, suitable for desktop applications without database requirements.

**Defense in Depth**: Multi-layer security approach:
1. Application layer: Input validation, secure hashing
2. Transport layer: Tauri IPC security
3. Process layer: Account lockout, session management
4. System layer: File permissions, audit logging

**Performance Considerations**: Argon2 parameters balanced for security vs. performance on desktop hardware.

## Architecture Insights

**Security-First Design**: All authentication decisions prioritize security over convenience, with Argon2 hashing, lockout protection, and audit logging as core features.

**Desktop-Optimized**: Single-user model and file-based storage reflect desktop application constraints and use cases.

**TDD Approach**: Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability and prevents regressions in security-critical code.

**Error Handling**: Secure error messages prevent information leakage while maintaining usability.

**Scalability Considerations**: Current implementation suitable for single-user desktop use; would require architectural changes for multi-user scenarios.

## Historical Context (from docs/)

From `docs/SECURITY.md`:
- Authentication uses Argon2 hashing with salt for secure password storage
- Account lockout implemented after 5 failed attempts
- Session management with 24-hour expiration

From `AGENTS.md`:
- Security requirements mandate input validation and secure password storage
- Account protection with lockout mechanisms
- Authentication implementation includes session management

From `thoughts/implementation-decisions.md`:
- Local username/password authentication chosen over OAuth for desktop simplicity
- Argon2 selected for superior security compared to older algorithms

## Open Questions

1. **Lockout Duration**: Is 30-minute lockout duration optimal for desktop usage patterns?
2. **Session Security**: How are sessions validated across application restarts?
3. **Password Recovery**: What secure recovery options exist for single-owner model?
4. **Multi-User Evolution**: How would system evolve for multi-user support?
5. **Performance Impact**: What is the authentication overhead on startup/login times?
6. **Compliance**: Does implementation meet specific regulatory requirements (GDPR, CCPA)?
7. **Backup Security**: How are authentication credentials handled during backup/restore?

## Recommendations

1. **Maintain Security Standards**: Continue using Argon2 and lockout protection
2. **Enhance Monitoring**: Implement real-time security event alerting
3. **User Experience**: Consider lockout duration adjustments based on usage patterns
4. **Documentation**: Create dedicated authentication security guide
5. **Testing**: Expand E2E test coverage for edge cases
6. **Future Planning**: Design multi-user authentication architecture for potential expansion

This research provides a comprehensive understanding of the authentication system, highlighting its security strengths and areas for potential enhancement.
