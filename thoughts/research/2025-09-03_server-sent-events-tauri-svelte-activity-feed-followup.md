## Ticket Synopsis
Follow-up research to address the three open questions from the initial research on server-sent events, Tauri event emission, and Svelte activity feed integration.

## Summary
This follow-up research addresses the three open questions identified in the initial research document. Based on comprehensive analysis of Tauri community patterns, web research, and codebase examination, we provide concrete recommendations for handling event loss, implementing fallback strategies, and standardizing event payloads. The findings emphasize robust error handling, graceful degradation, and type-safe event systems for reliable real-time communication in OpenCode Nexus.

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Event Loss Handling and Buffering Strategies

#### Current State Analysis
The OpenCode Nexus codebase currently has no explicit event buffering or loss handling mechanisms. Events are emitted via `app_handle.emit_all()` but are not persisted or queued if the frontend is temporarily disconnected.

#### Recommended Solutions

**Backend Event Buffering:**
- Implement a ring buffer or persistent queue in the Rust backend to store recent events
- Use `tokio::sync::broadcast` with a larger capacity (currently 100) for internal buffering
- Persist critical events (errors, server stops) to disk for guaranteed delivery

**Frontend Reconnection Strategy:**
- Track the last received event ID/timestamp on the frontend
- On reconnection, request missed events via a Tauri command
- Implement exponential backoff for reconnection attempts

**Critical Event Handling:**
- Always persist error and server lifecycle events
- Provide a "catch-up" summary of critical events on reconnection
- Use persistent storage for events that affect user state

#### Implementation Pattern
```rust
// Backend: Event buffer with persistence
struct EventBuffer {
    buffer: VecDeque<ServerEvent>,
    critical_events: HashMap<String, ServerEvent>,
    max_size: usize,
}

impl EventBuffer {
    fn add_event(&mut self, event: ServerEvent) {
        // Add to ring buffer
        self.buffer.push_back(event.clone());
        if self.buffer.len() > self.max_size {
            self.buffer.pop_front();
        }
        
        // Persist critical events
        if matches!(event.event_type, ServerEventType::Error | ServerEventType::Stopped) {
            self.critical_events.insert(event.id.clone(), event);
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Fallback Strategies for Tauri Event System Failures

#### Current State Analysis
OpenCode Nexus has polling as a fallback mechanism in `dashboard.astro` (30-second intervals for metrics), but lacks comprehensive failure detection and graceful degradation strategies.

#### Recommended Solutions

**Detection Mechanisms:**
- Implement heartbeat/ping-pong events between backend and frontend
- Use timeouts for expected event responses
- Monitor event listener registration and error callbacks

**Graceful Degradation:**
- Switch to polling when events fail (reduce frequency to avoid resource waste)
- Provide user feedback about degraded functionality
- Maintain core functionality even when real-time updates are unavailable

**Recovery Strategies:**
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- State synchronization after recovery
- Clear user notifications when real-time updates are restored

#### Implementation Pattern
```typescript
// Frontend: Fallback detection and recovery
class EventManager {
    private eventSystemHealthy = true;
    private reconnectAttempts = 0;
    private maxReconnectAttempts = 5;
    
    async detectFailure() {
        // Send ping event
        const pingId = crypto.randomUUID();
        this.emit('ping', { id: pingId });
        
        // Wait for pong with timeout
        const pongReceived = await this.waitForPong(pingId, 5000);
        
        if (!pongReceived) {
            this.handleEventSystemFailure();
        }
    }
    
    async handleEventSystemFailure() {
        this.eventSystemHealthy = false;
        this.showUserNotification('Real-time updates unavailable. Switching to periodic updates...');
        
        // Switch to polling
        this.startPollingFallback();
        
        // Attempt recovery
        this.attemptReconnection();
    }
    
    async attemptReconnection() {
        if (this.reconnectAttempts >= this.maxReconnectAttempts) {
            this.showUserNotification('Unable to restore real-time updates. Please restart the application.');
            return;
        }
        
        this.reconnectAttempts++;
        const delay = Math.min(1000 * Math.pow(2, this.reconnectAttempts), 30000);
        
        setTimeout(async () => {
            try {
                await this.reestablishEventListeners();
                this.eventSystemHealthy = true;
                this.reconnectAttempts = 0;
                this.showUserNotification('Real-time updates restored!');
                await this.syncMissedState();
            } catch (error) {
                this.attemptReconnection();
            }
        }, delay);
    }
}
```

### 3. Event Payload Standardization Patterns

#### Current State Analysis
OpenCode Nexus uses `ServerEvent` struct with `ServerEventType` enum, which provides basic structure but lacks comprehensive standardization. Event payloads are not versioned and type safety could be improved.

#### Recommended Solutions

**Discriminated Unions:**
- Use tagged enums in Rust with `#[serde(tag = "type")]` for extensible event types
- Mirror TypeScript union types for type safety across languages

**Type Safety Improvements:**
- Implement automated type generation from Rust to TypeScript
- Use tools like `typeshare` or `typify` to maintain consistency
- Add runtime validation for event payloads

**Event Versioning:**
- Include version fields in event payloads
- Support multiple versions during transition periods
- Document event schema changes

#### Implementation Pattern
```rust
// Backend: Standardized event payload
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
#[serde(tag = "type", content = "payload")]
pub enum StandardizedEvent {
    #[serde(rename = "server_status")]
    ServerStatus {
        version: u8,
        status: ServerStatus,
        timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    },
    
    #[serde(rename = "activity_message")]
    ActivityMessage {
        version: u8,
        message: String,
        level: ActivityLevel,
        timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    },
    
    #[serde(rename = "session_update")]
    SessionUpdate {
        version: u8,
        session_id: String,
        action: SessionAction,
        timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    },
}

// Type-safe wrapper
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct EventEnvelope {
    pub id: String,
    pub timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub event: StandardizedEvent,
}
```

```typescript
// Frontend: Mirrored TypeScript types
type StandardizedEvent =
  | { type: "server_status"; payload: { version: number; status: ServerStatus; timestamp: string } }
  | { type: "activity_message"; payload: { version: number; message: string; level: ActivityLevel; timestamp: string } }
  | { type: "session_update"; payload: { version: number; session_id: string; action: SessionAction; timestamp: string } };

interface EventEnvelope {
  id: string;
  timestamp: string;
  event: StandardizedEvent;
}
```

## Architecture Insights

### Event Loss Prevention
- **Buffer Size**: Limit to 100-500 events to prevent memory issues
- **Critical Event Persistence**: Always persist errors and state-changing events
- **Reconnection Protocol**: Standardize the reconnection handshake process

### Fallback Strategy Design
- **Detection Thresholds**: Define clear criteria for when to trigger fallbacks
- **User Communication**: Provide clear, non-technical feedback about system state
- **Recovery Automation**: Implement smart reconnection with progressive backoff

### Payload Standardization Benefits
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time guarantees across Rust and TypeScript
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new event types without breaking changes
- **Versioning**: Support gradual migration and backwards compatibility
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting event schemas through type definitions
