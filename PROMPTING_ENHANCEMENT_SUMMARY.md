# Research-Backed Prompting Enhancement Summary

This document summarizes the research-backed prompting techniques added to AGENTS.md based on comprehensive 2024-2025 AI research.

## Techniques Added and Their Research Foundation

### 1. Expert Persona Framework
**Research Foundation:** Based on "Expert Persona Prompting" research (2024-2025) showing up to 37% performance improvement when LLMs embody domain expertise. However, research also shows mixed results on accuracy-based tasks, so this is balanced with other frameworks.

**Key Implementation:**
- Domain-specific expertise embodiment
- Confidence of seasoned professionals
- Specialized knowledge application

### 2. Systematic Approach
**Research Foundation:** Derived from multiple 2024-2025 studies on systematic problem-solving in AI, including the "POWER Framework" and "Three-Layer Framework for AI Testing."

**Key Implementation:**
- Step-by-step analysis with "deep breath" pause
- Component decomposition
- Methodical reasoning for multi-step tasks
- Structured thinking patterns

### 3. Stakes Awareness
**Research Foundation:** Based on 2025 research showing AI performance improves when tasks are framed as high-stakes scenarios, particularly in human-AI collaboration studies.

**Key Implementation:**
- Critical task framing
- Impact recognition
- High-quality standards
- Real-world consequence awareness

### 4. Quality Assurance
**Research Foundation:** Integrated from "Uncertainty Quantification and Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models" survey (June 2025) and "SaySelf" framework research.

**Key Implementation:**
- Confidence level self-assessment (0-1 scale)
- Assumption and limitation identification
- Uncertainty estimates
- Knowledge gap acknowledgment

### 5. Challenge Optimization
**Research Foundation:** Based on 2024-2025 research into incentive alignment and challenge mindset effects on AI performance, including studies on "monetary incentive prompting" effects.

**Key Implementation:**
- Challenge mindset for difficult problems
- Enhanced reasoning for edge cases
- Persistent multi-approach methodology
- Internal "I bet you can't solve this" framing

### 6. Monetary Incentive Framing (Internal)
**Research Foundation:** Derived from Cornell and other 2025 studies showing monetary incentives improve AI reliance and performance, adapted for internal motivation.

**Key Implementation:**
- High-value solution framing
- Significant reward justification
- Excellence over "good enough" standards

### 7. Forest-of-Thought (FoT) Reasoning
**Research Foundation:** Based on "Forest-of-Thought: Scaling Test-Time Compute for Enhancing LLM Reasoning" (December 2024, revised April 2025).

**Key Implementation:**
- Multiple parallel reasoning trees
- Sparse activation for path selection
- Dynamic self-correction strategies
- Consensus-guided decision-making

### 8. Tree-of-Thought (ToT) Enhancement
**Research Foundation:** Enhanced from original ToT research (2023) with 2024-2025 improvements showing 74% success vs 4% with CoT on planning tasks.

**Key Implementation:**
- Intermediate thought step decomposition
- Multiple solution path exploration
- BFS/DFS search algorithms
- Branch evaluation and pruning

### 9. Multi-Thinking Modes Tree (MTMT)
**Research Foundation:** Based on "MTMT: Consolidating Multiple Thinking Modes to Form a Thought Tree" (December 2024).

**Key Implementation:**
- Association and counterfactual thinking
- Task decomposition and comparison
- Sub-question breakdown
- Latent knowledge leveraging

### 10. Uncertainty Quantification Integration
**Research Foundation:** Combined from "A Decision-driven Methodology for Designing Uncertainty-aware AI Self-Assessment" (2024) and confidence calibration research.

**Key Implementation:**
- Confidence assessments for technical decisions
- Self-reflection for knowledge gaps
- Calibrated confidence estimates
- Self-reflective rationales

## Research Methodology

The enhancement was developed through:

1. **Comprehensive Literature Review:** Searched 2024-2025 AI prompting research across arXiv, academic conferences, and industry publications.

2. **Technique Validation:** Each technique was verified through multiple research sources to ensure robustness and applicability.

3. **Practical Adaptation:** Academic research was adapted for practical application in software development contexts.

4. **Integration Strategy:** Techniques were organized into a coherent framework that builds from basic to advanced reasoning.

## Expected Impact

Based on research findings, these techniques should provide:
- Up to 37% performance improvement on domain-specific tasks
- Enhanced problem-solving capabilities for complex multi-step issues
- Better uncertainty quantification and confidence calibration
- Improved reasoning through structured thought processes
- Higher quality outputs through systematic quality assurance

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Start Simple:** Begin with basic frameworks (Expert Persona, Systematic Approach) for routine tasks.

2. **Scale Complexity:** Use advanced reasoning frameworks (FoT, ToT, MTMT) for complex problems.

3. **Apply Quality Assurance:** Always use self-evaluation and uncertainty quantification.

4. **Adapt Contextually:** Select techniques based on task complexity and requirements.
