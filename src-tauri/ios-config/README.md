# iOS Build Configuration

This directory contains configuration files needed for iOS builds.

## Files

### ExportOptions.plist
This file specifies how the iOS app should be exported for App Store distribution. It's used by `xcodebuild -exportArchive` command during the CI/CD build process.

**Key settings:**
- **method**: `app-store` - Builds for App Store distribution
- **teamID**: `PCJU8QD9FN` - Apple Developer Team ID
- **signingStyle**: `manual` - Manual code signing (using provisioning profiles from secrets)
- **provisioningProfiles**: Maps bundle ID to provisioning profile name
- **uploadSymbols**: `true` - Upload crash report symbols to App Store Connect

## Usage

During the iOS build workflow (`.github/workflows/ios-release.yml`), this file should be copied to `src-tauri/gen/apple/ExportOptions.plist` after running `cargo tauri ios init`.

Add this step to the workflow:
```yaml
- name: Copy ExportOptions.plist
  run: |
    cp src-tauri/ios-config/ExportOptions.plist src-tauri/gen/apple/ExportOptions.plist
```

## Local Development

If you're building iOS locally on macOS:

1. Initialize the iOS project:
   ```bash
   cargo tauri ios init
   ```

2. Copy the export options:
   ```bash
   cp src-tauri/ios-config/ExportOptions.plist src-tauri/gen/apple/
   ```

3. Build the app:
   ```bash
   cargo tauri ios build --release
   ```

## Notes

- The `gen/apple` directory is generated by Tauri and is git-ignored
- This template file ensures consistent export settings across all iOS builds
- Update the `teamID` and `provisioningProfiles` if the Apple Developer account changes
