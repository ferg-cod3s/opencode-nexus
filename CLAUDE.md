# CLAUDE.md – OpenCode Nexus Development Guide

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with the OpenCode Nexus codebase.

## Project Overview

OpenCode Nexus is a **cross-platform desktop application** for managing OpenCode servers with secure remote access. Built with **Tauri** (Rust backend) + **Astro/Svelte 5** (frontend) + **Bun** runtime, it provides a comprehensive solution for OpenCode server lifecycle management, authentication, and secure tunneling.

**Key Features:**
- Server process management (start/stop/restart with monitoring)
- User authentication with Argon2 hashing and session management
- Real-time metrics and event streaming
- Cloudflared tunnel integration for secure remote access
- Cross-platform system requirements detection
- Comprehensive accessibility support (WCAG 2.2 AA compliant)

## Quick Start Commands

### Frontend Development (Astro + Svelte)
```bash
cd frontend
bun install              # Install dependencies
bun run dev              # Development server
bun run build            # Production build
bun test                 # Run tests with Bun
bun run lint             # ESLint with accessibility checks
bun run typecheck        # TypeScript checking
```

### Backend Development (Rust + Tauri)
```bash
# Core Tauri development (from project root)
cargo tauri dev          # Run full application (backend + frontend)
cargo tauri build        # Build production application

# Rust backend only (from src-tauri/ directory)
cargo build              # Build Rust backend
cargo test               # Run unit tests
cargo clippy             # Linting and code analysis
cargo fmt                # Code formatting

# Server management testing
cargo test server_manager  # Test server lifecycle management
cargo test auth            # Test authentication system
```

### Full Stack Development
```bash
# Complete development workflow
cargo tauri dev          # Starts both Rust backend and frontend with hot reload

# Comprehensive testing
cargo test               # Backend tests (auth, server management, onboarding)
cd frontend && bun test  # Frontend tests (UI components, accessibility)

# Quality assurance
cargo clippy && cd frontend && bun run lint && bun run typecheck
```

## Development Standards & Requirements

### Core Principles
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write failing tests before implementation - MANDATORY
- **Security First**: All user inputs validated, secure password storage (Argon2)
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.2 AA compliance required for all UI components
- **Cross-Platform**: Support macOS, Linux, and Windows

### Code Quality Requirements
- **Function Size**: Target 10-30 lines, max 50 before refactoring

**D. Progress Communication:**
Provide clear status including:
- Completed phase/feature with reference to implementation plan
- Current progress percentage vs [TODO.md](TODO.md) targets
- Next development priorities from [thoughts/plans/](thoughts/plans/)
- Any blockers or decisions needed to proceed

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Async/Await in Rust
- **Issue**: MutexGuard not Send-safe across await boundaries
- **Solution**: Extract data from mutex before await, don't hold locks across async calls

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **Issue**: Platform-specific system detection
- **Solution**: Use conditional compilation and platform-specific dependencies

### Accessibility Compliance
- **Issue**: Missing keyboard navigation or screen reader support
- **Solution**: Use proper ARIA labels, semantic HTML, and test with accessibility tools

## Security Requirements (Critical)

- **Password Storage**: Argon2 hashing with salt (implemented)
- **Account Protection**: Lockout after 5 failed attempts (implemented)
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize ALL user inputs before processing
- **Secret Management**: Never commit secrets - use environment variables
- **Process Security**: Secure OpenCode server process management

## Performance Standards

- **Startup Time**: Application should start in under 3 seconds
- **Bundle Size**: Keep frontend bundles under 1MB
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor Rust memory usage with Arc for shared data
- **Responsiveness**: UI should remain responsive during server operations

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Features (Phase 1-3)
- **Onboarding System**: 6-step wizard with cross-platform system detection ([src-tauri/src/onboarding.rs](src-tauri/src/onboarding.rs))
- **Authentication**: Argon2 hashing, account lockout, persistent sessions ([src-tauri/src/auth.rs](src-tauri/src/auth.rs))
- **Server Management**: Complete lifecycle management with real-time event streaming ([src-tauri/src/server_manager.rs](src-tauri/src/server_manager.rs))
- **Dashboard UI**: Reactive interface with accessibility compliance ([frontend/src/pages/dashboard.astro](frontend/src/pages/dashboard.astro))
- **Session Tracking**: OpenCode server session management with API integration
- **Testing**: TDD approach with 29 tests covering critical paths

### 🔄 Current Phase: Advanced Features (85% Complete)  
- **Cloudflared Integration**: Tunnel management system (stubbed, ready for implementation)
- **Real-time Metrics**: Event-driven architecture with live updates (implemented)
- **API Integration**: Full OpenCode server API client ([src-tauri/src/api_client.rs](src-tauri/src/api_client.rs))

### ⏳ Remaining Work
- Cloudflared tunnel implementation (Phase 4 from implementation plan)
- Advanced tunnel configuration options
- Log viewing and export functionality
- Performance optimization and production hardening

**Progress**: 60% complete - Core functionality operational, **CRITICAL MVP GAP identified**
**Next Priority**: 🚨 **Chat Interface Implementation** - The core AI conversation system is completely missing

## ⚠️ CRITICAL MVP ISSUE IDENTIFIED

**The current implementation lacks the primary chat interface that users expect from an OpenCode AI assistant.**

### Missing Core Functionality
- **Chat UI**: No conversational interface for interacting with OpenCode AI
- **Message Streaming**: No real-time message streaming from AI responses  
- **Session Management**: No chat session creation or conversation history
- **File Context**: No ability to share code files or project context with AI

### Implementation Required
This blocks MVP completion. See **Phase 0** in [thoughts/plans/opencode-nexus-mvp-implementation.md](thoughts/plans/opencode-nexus-mvp-implementation.md) for detailed chat interface implementation plan.

**Files to Create:**
- `src-tauri/src/chat_manager.rs` - Chat session and message management
- `src-tauri/src/message_stream.rs` - Real-time SSE message streaming  
- `frontend/src/pages/chat.astro` - Main chat interface
- `frontend/src/components/ChatInterface.svelte` - Chat UI components

## Emergency Procedures

### Security Incident
1. Immediately revoke compromised credentials
2. Assess scope and impact
3. Patch vulnerability
4. Document and implement prevention measures

### Critical Bug
1. Reproduce with failing test
2. Identify root cause
3. Implement minimal fix
4. Verify fix and test for regressions

---

**Key Reminders:**
- 🚨 **CRITICAL**: Chat interface implementation blocks MVP - highest priority
- Always follow TDD principles (tests first) - see [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md)
- Security and accessibility are non-negotiable - see [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) and WCAG 2.2 AA
- Reference comprehensive documentation in [docs/](docs/) for all architectural decisions
- Update [TODO.md](TODO.md) and commit completed work following [documentation workflow](#4-documentation--commit-mandatory)
- Current progress: 60% complete with critical chat functionality missing

## Essential Context for AI Development
- **Project Type**: Tauri desktop application (NOT web app or monorepo)
- **Current Status**: Server management complete, chat interface completely missing
- **Architecture**: See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for Tauri-specific patterns
- **Next Phase**: Implement chat interface per [thoughts/plans/opencode-nexus-mvp-implementation.md](thoughts/plans/opencode-nexus-mvp-implementation.md)
- **Test Coverage**: 29 tests established, expand for new chat functionality
