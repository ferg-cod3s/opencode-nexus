### 🚨 E2E Test Assessment (2025-10-01)
**Status**: 23/121 tests passing (19% pass rate)

**Passing** ✅:
- Authentication (19/19 - 100%): Login, security, session management, accessibility
- Dashboard (2/2 - 100%): Redirect behavior tests

**Failing** ❌:
- Chat Interface (~12/14): Missing backend integration for message streaming
- Chat Spec (~13/13): All timeout - chat elements not rendering
- Critical Flows (~8): Blocked by missing chat functionality
- Server Management (~15): Button state/authentication dependency issues
- Onboarding (~10): Persistent state and routing issues
- Performance/Full Flow (~10): Depend on functional chat/server features

**Root Causes**:
1. **Chat Interface Missing** - Primary blocker affecting ~35-40 tests (30% of suite)
2. **Tauri Backend Dependency** - Tests run in browser mode with mocks
3. **Server State Management** - Tests need server state reset helpers
4. **Onboarding Routing** - Only accessible on first run (persistent state issue)

**Recommendation**: Prioritize chat interface backend integration per Phase 0 MVP plan to unblock 30% of failing tests.
